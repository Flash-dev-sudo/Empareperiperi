# Render Deployment Guide for Emparo Peri Peri

## Current Status
✅ Application running locally on port 5000
✅ React build files exist in `dist/public/`
✅ Server configured with `simple-server.js`
✅ Package.json configured with correct start command

## Next Steps for Render Deployment

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
Your local changes need to be pushed to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Final deployment setup with working React build"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Render Will Automatically Deploy
Once you push to GitHub, Render will:
- Clone your repository
- Run `npm install` (build command)
- Start with `npm run start` (runs simple-server.js)
- Deploy to: https://empareperiperi.onrender.com

### 3. What's Fixed Since Last Deploy
- ✅ Added build script to package.json
- ✅ Switched dev command to use simple-server.js
- ✅ React build files are ready (13MB in dist/public/)
- ✅ Server correctly serves static files from dist/public/

### 4. Environment Variables (if needed)
If your app uses a database, make sure these are set in Render:
- DATABASE_URL (if using external database)
- NODE_ENV=production

## Your Render Service Configuration
- **Repository**: Connected to your GitHub repo
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start`
- **Node Version**: 20 (specified in .nvmrc)

The deployment should work seamlessly now since all configuration issues have been resolved.
