Thanks for sharing the updated homepage. You've clearly implemented a lot of improvements — well done. Below is a focused **post-update review** listing **what’s working well**, followed by **immediate fixes still required**.

## ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Header UI**:

   * “Order Online” button is now visually clear and stands out well in the header.

2. **Hero Section**:

   * Text and design layout are nicely aligned.
   * Good hierarchy between heading, subheading, and CTA.

3. **Menu Sections**:

   * Spacing and grid layout are more consistent.
   * Tags like “Spicy Level,” “Customer Favorite,” and “Mild Spice” are readable and useful.
   * Product cards feel visually balanced.

4. **Social Section**:

   * Integration with Instagram-style layout adds appeal.
   * Clear call-to-actions: “Follow on Instagram” and “Like on Facebook”.

5. **Location & Contact Section**:

   * Map is working.
   * Address and call-to-order button are now clear and functional.

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes (Post-Update)

### 1. ❌ **Main Hero Image (Still fried chicken)**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Image still shows deep-fried crispy chicken, which contradicts “Flame-Grilled Chicken”.
* ✅ **Fix**: Replace with grilled chicken showing **char lines**, ideally flame-lit or on a grill to match the copy.

### 2. ❌ **Duplicate Item: “Peri Peri Wrap”**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Still shown twice in different sections with different descriptions.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Rename one to “**Crispy Peri Peri Wrap**”
  * Rename the other to “**Grilled Peri Wrap**”
  * Keep spice tags consistent.

### 3. ❌ **Inconsistent Use of Tags and Icons**

* 🔴 **Problem**:

  * Some items have tags like "Side Favorite", "Popular Choice" — others don’t.
  * Some have spice level icons, others don’t.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Ensure **every item** either has a spice level or a tag.
  * Use a standard set:

    * 🔥 Very Spicy
    * 🌶 Medium
    * ❄️ Mild
    * ⭐ Best Seller / Customer Favorite

### 4. ❌ **@Username Placeholder in Social Section**

* 🔴 **Problem**: “@Username” is still used across all Instagram cards.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Use real IG handles if possible.
  * Or remove entirely and add CTA:

    > "Tag us on Instagram @emparopizza"

### 5. ❌ **Missing Testimonials / Trust Elements**

* 🔴 **Problem**: No customer feedback, reviews, or ratings shown.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Add a small section before or after “Popular Menu Items”:

    > ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
    > “Best wings in Finsbury Park — the grilled ones are unreal!”

### 6. ❌ **Call-to-Order and Order Online Redundancy**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Multiple "Order Online" and "Order Now" CTAs — users may not know which is phone vs. website.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Update the yellow section:

    > 📞 **Call to Order** – 020 3441 6940
    > 💻 **Order Online** – Click the button in the header or menu

---

### 7. ❌ **Link Visibility in Footer**

* 🔴 **Problem**: “Privacy Policy” and “Terms of Service” still appear unlinked.
* ✅ **Fix**: Link them to actual static pages or PDF placeholders for now.

---

### 8. ❌ **Button Spacing and Hover Effects**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Some CTAs (especially in “Follow Us” and “Order Now” sections) feel too static or flat.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Add a **hover effect**: slight scale-up or background highlight.
  * Increase top/bottom padding in buttons for mobile readability.

---

### 9. ❌ **Image Quality Variation**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Some images (e.g., nuggets, fries) are slightly overexposed or flat compared to others.
* ✅ **Fix**: Slight color correction or consistent lighting to make all images pop equally.

---

### 10. ❌ **No Internal Page Links or Menu Navigation**

* 🔴 **Problem**: Users can’t jump from top menu to "Popular Items", "Visit Us", etc.
* ✅ **Fix**:

  * Add internal anchor links in navbar or header:

    > Home | Menu | Location | Contact
    > Use `id="menu"`, `id="contact"` and scroll to them.

---

## ✅ Optional (But Good to Do Soon)

* Add `meta description` and `og:image` for better SEO & sharing.
* Add a favicon to match the brand.
* Highlight offers or combos with badges.
* Add Google Review badge or Yelp rating if available.
