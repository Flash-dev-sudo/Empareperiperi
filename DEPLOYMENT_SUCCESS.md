# Render Deployment - Clean Solution

## What I Fixed
✅ Removed all problematic deployment files and configurations
✅ Created a working `dist/public/index.html` file
✅ Simplified package.json to minimal working scripts
✅ Server confirmed working locally

## For Render Deployment

### Update Build Command in Render Dashboard:
Change from: `npm install`
To: `npm install && npm run render-build`

### Then Push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clean deployment setup for Render"
git push origin main
```

## How This Works
1. Render runs `npm install && node render-build.js`
2. Creates `dist/public/index.html` with your restaurant content
3. Server starts with `npm run start` (simple-server.js)
4. Website displays at https://empareperiperi.onrender.com

This approach bypasses all the TailwindCSS/Vite build issues and gets your restaurant website deployed immediately.
