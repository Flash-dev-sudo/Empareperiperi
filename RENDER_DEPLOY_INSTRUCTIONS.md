# Render Deployment Fix for Emparo Peri Peri

## Problem Identified
Your React build files (`dist/public/`) exist locally but are not in your GitHub repository because:
1. `dist` folder is in `.gitignore` 
2. Render clones from GitHub and finds no build files
3. Server fails with: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/opt/render/project/src/dist/public/index.html'`

## Solution Applied
1. Fixed PostCSS config to use CommonJS syntax (not ES modules)
2. Added proper build script to package.json
3. Created working vite.config.ts that builds on Render

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Update Render Build Command
In your Render dashboard, change the **Build Command** from:
```
npm install
```
To:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment with proper build process"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Render Will Now Successfully Deploy
- Clone your repository
- Run `npm install && npm run build` (builds React app)
- Create `dist/public/` with all React files
- Start with `npm run start` (serves from dist/public/)
- Deploy successfully to https://empareperiperi.onrender.com

## Files Changed
- ✅ `postcss.config.js` - Fixed ES module syntax
- ✅ `package.json` - Added build script
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Simplified for Render compatibility
- ✅ Build tested locally and working
